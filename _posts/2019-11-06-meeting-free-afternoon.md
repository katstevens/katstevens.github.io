I didn't write a blog post yesterday as I was busy celebrating the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/) turning 5 with my team! I was quizmaster at our party, which meant I got to ask questions like "_How many disco balls do I keep on my desk?_"<sup>1</sup> and see if everyone has been paying attention. 

Today I got a good chunk of code written: the [coding vs engineering](https://katstevens.github.io/2019/11/05/coding-vs-engineering.html) ratio is slowly healing itself. It was especially satisfying to get my local branch into a state suitable for public consumption - it's been hanging around for a week now, unpushed, which always makes me itchy. It's no coincidence that my last big effort on the story was a week ago: our team has agreed that Thursday afternoons are to be kept 'meeting free', and I can safely stick my headphones in without [missing anything crucial](https://katstevens.github.io/2019/11/04/music-while-coding.html). As such, Thursday afternoons have become coding afternoons.

This week I had a good soundtrack to accompany me! At lunchtime it was my turn to 'take over' the GDS #club-music Slack channel and post some of my current favourite tunes, all from this year and all made by women. Here's a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/katstevens/playlist/03f7UTQ4YFbaTqjgRpdxYV?si=K6MhJz28ScimClfVaGeEGA). All the tracks are familiar enough to me that I won't get distracted, and they are boshing enough to make for a productive coding atmosphere.

<sup>1</sup>The answer is two! I turn them on when something 'exciting' is happening. I also have a blue flashing police light which rotates at a pathetically slow speed because the battery is running down. I have no idea where any of them came from, they just appeared one day.
